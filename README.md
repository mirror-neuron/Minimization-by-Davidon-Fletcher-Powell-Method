# Davidon-Fletcher-Powell-Method
This is implimentation of Quasi-Newton optimization method with Davidon–Fletcher–Powell formula in C++.
* One-dimensional search uses the golden-section search which nice for unimodal functions.
* To solve limited optimization problems, a penalty method is used.
* The designations and formula used can be seen in paper.pdf
