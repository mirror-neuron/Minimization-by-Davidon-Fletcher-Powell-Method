# Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
This is implimentation of Quasi-Newton optimization method with Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno formula in C++.
* One-dimensional search uses the golden-section search which nice for unimodal functions.
* To solve limited optimization problems, a penalty method is used.
* For simplicity and clarity, operator overloading is used in the class with matrices
* The formula used can be seen in paper.pdf, also covector class it is transposed vector
