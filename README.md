# Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
This is implimentation of Quasi-Newton optimization method with BFGS algorithm in C/C++.
* One-dimensional search uses the golden-section search which is suitable for unimodal functions.
* For solving constrained optimization problems, a penalty method is used.
* For simplicity and clarity, operator overloading implemented in the matrices class with C++.
